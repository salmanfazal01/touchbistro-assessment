Full Stack - Developer Challenge

Instructions
The goal of this challenge is to create a simple web app consisting of:
● A frontend using React.js
● A Node.js backend using a framework of your choice (e.g. Express, Koa, pure http, etc.)
● Tests for both sections using a framework of your choice (e.g. Jest, Mocha/Chai, etc.)
● Any NPM package is allowed although which packages are included and their use will
be considered as part of the sample
● We will be assessing the challenge based on code style, working functionality, usage of
modern JavaScript (ES6), and test practices. TypeScript is allowed and encouraged, as
is the use of React hooks.

Backend Component
Set up a Node.js server with a single route. This route should execute your implementation of
the following function, and return its output:

Function
Given an upper limit of n, write a javascript function that will find the median prime number(s) of
the set of prime numbers less than n.

Example
a) If n = 10, the set of prime numbers less than 10 is [2,3,5,7], and so the medians are [3,5]
b) If n = 18, the set of prime numbers less than 18 is [2,3,5,7,11,13,17], and so the median is [7]

Hint
Look up the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm if you want your implementation to work in a
realistic amount of time when n > 10,000. Googling is encouraged!

Frontend Component
Set up a frontend where a user can input a number, and receive the result of the above function
(or an appropriate error message).

Testing
Include appropriate tests (as you define them) in both the frontend and backend components.


Update
I applied for a front-end only role and I was given a full-stack assessment to do. I completed it however, I did not pass the assessment, I asked for a reason and I was not given any. Shame on the Touchbristo team.
